## Mathematical Problems
 - to print last digit for decimal number use mod (% 10)
 - to delete last digit for decimal number use division ( / 10)
 - to get all divisor of a number , go through all numbers from 1  > half of the number 
   and check if value has no reminder
 - prime number is a natural number that is greater than 1 and is exclusively
   divisible by itself and by 1.
 - A prime number is a natural number that is greater than 1 and is exclusively
  divisible by itself and by 1.
 - a number is called a perfect number if its value is equal to the sum of its real
   divisors (i.e., excluding itself )
  - Armstrong numbers. These are numbers whose individual digits are first
   exponentiated by the number of digits in the number and then added together
  - Any natural number greater than 1 can be represented as a multiplication of
   primes

  ## string processing
  - StringBuilder and StringBuffer are the common classes for string processing
  - StringBuilder is not thread safe but StringBuffer is thread safe 
  - It is fine to use String StringBuilder in one threaded problem
  - they have delete, insert and reverse functions although they do not have toLower or toUpperCase() functions
  - The Character class is abstract for one char and has useful functions like getNumericValue(), isDigit(), isWhiteSpace() and so one
  - homemade conversions
      int digitValue = digitAsChar - '0';
      int posOfChar = currentChar - 'A';

  - if you need map with order use TreeMap implementation
