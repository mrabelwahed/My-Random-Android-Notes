## Mathematical Problems
 - to print last digit for decimal number use mod (% 10)
 - to delete last digit for decimal number use division ( / 10)
 - to get all divisor of a number , go through all numbers from 1  > half of the number 
   and check if value has no reminder
 - prime number is a natural number that is greater than 1 and is exclusively
   divisible by itself and by 1.
 - A prime number is a natural number that is greater than 1 and is exclusively
  divisible by itself and by 1.
 - a number is called a perfect number if its value is equal to the sum of its real
   divisors (i.e., excluding itself )
  - Armstrong numbers. These are numbers whose individual digits are first
   exponentiated by the number of digits in the number and then added together
  - Any natural number greater than 1 can be represented as a multiplication of
   primes
